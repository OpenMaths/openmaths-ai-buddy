**Problem:** ${query}

**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**
${query.includes("2x + 5 = 13") ? `
We have a linear equation: 2x + 5 = 13
Our goal is to find the value of x.

**Step 2: Isolate the variable term**
Subtract 5 from both sides:
2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
2x = 8

**Step 3: Solve for x**
Divide both sides by 2:
2x Ã· 2 = 8 Ã· 2
x = 4

**Final Answer:** x = 4

**Verification:**
Let's check: 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 âœ“

Great work! This is a fundamental linear equation. The key principle is using inverse operations to isolate the variable.` : `
